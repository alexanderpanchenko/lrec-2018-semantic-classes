	synonymy dictionaries and word embeddings. First, we build a weighted graph of
	synonyms extracted from commonly available resources, such as Wiktionary.
	Second, we apply word sense induction to deal with ambiguous words. Finally, we
	cluster the disambiguated version of the ambiguous input graph into synsets.
	Our meta-clustering approach lets us use an efficient hard clustering algorithm
	to perform a fuzzy clustering of the graph. Despite its simplicity, our
	approach shows excellent results, outperforming five competitive
	state-of-the-art methods in terms of F-score on three gold standard datasets
	for English and Russian derived from large-scale manually constructed lexical
	resources.},

Given a sentence, the system chooses the most relevant sense of each input word with respect to the semantic similarity between the given sentence and the synset constituting the sense of the target word. Mnogoznal has two modes of operation. The sparse mode uses the traditional vector space model to estimate the most similar word sense corresponding to its context. The dense mode, instead, uses synset embeddings to cope with the sparsity problem. We describe the architecture of the present system and also conduct its evaluation on three different lexical semantic resources for Russian. We found that the dense mode substantially outperforms the sparse one on all datasets according to the adjusted Rand index.}
