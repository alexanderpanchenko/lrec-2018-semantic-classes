	is natural to use both positive and negative training examples in supervised
	relation extraction, the impact of positive examples on hypernym prediction was
	not studied so far. In this paper, we show that explicit negative examples used
	for regularization of the model significantly improve performance compared to
	the state-of-the-art approach of Fu et al. (2014) on three datasets from

	cluster the disambiguated version of the ambiguous input graph into synsets.
	Our meta-clustering approach lets us use an efficient hard clustering algorithm

	knowledge-based system while it remains completely unsupervised and

	providing interpretable word sense inventories, sense representations, and
